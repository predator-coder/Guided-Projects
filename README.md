# Guided-Projects (Deep Learning NanoDegree)

## 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns (Project 1)

In this roject, I build and train my own Neural Network from Scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## 2. Dog Breed Classifier (Project 2)

In this project, I build a pipeline to process real-world, user-simplified images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the canine's breed.

## 3. Generate TV Scripts (Project 3)

In this project, I generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts usig RNNs. I used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural networks I build generates a new, "fake" TV script.

## 4. Generate Faces (Project 4)

In this project, I used a Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new images of faces.

## 5. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model (Project 5)

In this project, I build and deploy a neural networkwhich predicts the sentiments of a user-provided movie review. In addition, I also created a simple web app that uses my deployed model for interaction with users.
